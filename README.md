### 🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to analyze and predict student exam scores based on various features such as study time, attendance, and previous scores.
It includes:

* Data preprocessing and visualization (in Jupyter Notebook)
* Model training and evaluation
* Deployment using **FastAPI** inside a **Docker** container

---

### ✨ Features

* 📈 Visualize performance trends using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
* 🤖 Train regression/classification models to predict exam outcomes
* ⚡ Deploy trained models with **FastAPI**
* 🐳 Containerized deployment using **Docker**

---

### 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Python 3.10+**
* **FastAPI**
* **Docker**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-learn**

```

---

### 🐳 Running the Application with Docker

Build and run the container:

```bash
docker build -t student-exam-analysis .
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 student-exam-analysis
```

Access the FastAPI app at: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

---

### 🚀 Usage

* Explore data and train models in **Jupyter Notebook**:

  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
* Use **FastAPI** endpoints to send new student data and get predictions.

---

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize relationships between:

* Study hours vs Exam marks
* Attendance vs Performance
* Previous Scores vs Exam Scores

---

### 🔌 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint   | Description                                         |
| ------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/predict` | Returns predicted exam score for given student data |
| `GET`  | `/health`  | Health check for the API                            |

Example request:

```json
{
  "study_hours": 5,
  "attendance": 92,
  "previous_score": 80
}
```

---

### 🧾 Results

* Achieved **R² score of 0.87** on test data
* Insights show that **study hours** and **previous performance** are the strongest predictors of final exam marks
